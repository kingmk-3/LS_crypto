# `Assignment: RSA-ddler`

## Description of the files in the folder:

### brainfuck_interpreter.py : `This take message from taut.txt and outputs the password of ?????.zip`

### Crack.py : `It has various parameter extracted manually(uses famous RSA numbers), then computes the original message taking the encyption from ?????.py`

### output.txt : `Rough work`

## Note: `No script for unzipping was used, because Macbooks had that in-built(so an easy advantage for me)`
